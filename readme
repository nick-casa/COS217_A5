What is your mywc program test plan?


Boundary tests:

mywcXXX.txt: Description of the characteristics of that file, and how it tests boundary conditions of the mywc.c and mywc.s programs.
mywc100.txt: Empty file, tests if there are 0 new lines, words and characters
mywc101.txt: One space character
mywc102.txt: One new line
mywc103.txt: One character
mywc104.txt: One character on second line
mywc105.txt: New line, space, character, space, new line

Statement tests:

mywcXXX.txt: Description of the characteristics of that file, and which lines of the mywc.c and mywc.s programs it causes the computer to execute.
mywc200.txt: Executes all lines of mywc.c.
// Starts with a space to enter the loop, next character (not a space) tests the else conditional

"This file contains such-and-such characteristics, and so causes the
computer to execute lines x, y, ..., and z of the given mywc.c"
(where x, y, ..., and z are line numbers). Collectively your statement
test files should cause the computer to execute all lines of the given
mywc.c file (and so, by assumption, all lines of your mywc.s file).

Stress tests:

mywcXXX.txt: Description of the characteristics of that file, and how it stress tests the mywc.c and mywc.s programs.
