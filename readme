Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment was not the most fun if I am being honest. I felt
like we have learned enough to do all of the challenge portions before,
but for this assignment, I feel like I had to teach myself extra
commands and learn how carries work.

Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Helpful for learning how to write in assembly but the challenge portion
was difficult

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What is your mywc program test plan?

To test mywc, we will compose boundary, statement, and stress tests that
ensure that the program is doing exactly what we want it to do in every
case scenario.

Boundary tests:

mywc100.txt: Empty file, tests if there are 0 new lines, words and
    characters.
mywc101.txt: One space character. Tests if it can pick up one space
    without a new line or char
mywc102.txt: One new line. Tests if it can pick up one new line
    without a space or char
mywc103.txt: One character. Tests if it can pick up one new char
    without a space or new line
mywc104.txt: One character on second line. Tests if the program
    can pick up on a sandwiched character and both new lines
mywc105.txt: New line, space, character, space, new line.
    Tests a char surrounded by spaces and new lines.

Statement tests:

mywc200.txt: Executes all lines of mywc.c. First, the space gets it
into the loop on line 30. Then, since it enters the loop, line 31
gets executed. Then, since the first letter is a space, it enters
the conditional on line 33, then in the first iteration, it does
not hit the condition on line 34. Then, when the loop hits the first
"a", the "else" of the conditional on line 39 gits hit along with the
conditional on line 40. Then, when the second space is iterated over,
the conditional on like 34 is hit, along with the statements in 35
and 36. Finally, when the new line is hit, the conditional on line
42 is entered. Since the last char is a part of a word, line 45 also
gets executed.



Stress tests:

mywc300-302.txt: The file is a set of 50,000 chars split across 1,000
lines. This is a procedurally generated file which makes each of the
files pseudo-random. By testing pure volume, we can test the outcome
of the program on long files.
